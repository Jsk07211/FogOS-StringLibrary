NAME
	scanf - input FILE format conversion

SYNOPSIS
	#include "user/string.h"

	int scanf(const char *restrict format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
	scanf() reads input from the standard input stream stdin

	scanf() currently supports the following formats:
	* %d, if an int is to be stored into an int * 

	* %s, if a string is to be stored in a char *

	The programmer is responsible for ensuring that the formats in the format string 
	corresponds to the right type of buffer, and that the correct number of buffers
	has been provided in the arguments. 

	The range for integers is: 0 <= x < 1,000,000,000 to prevent integer overflow
	without strtol or strtoll.

RETURN VALUE
	On success, these functions return the number of input items successfuly matched 
	and assigned; this can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of
	an early matching failure.
