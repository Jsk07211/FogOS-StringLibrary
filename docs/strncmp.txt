NAME
	strncmp - compare two strings

SYNOPSIS
	#include "user/string.h"

	int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, uint n);

DESCRIPTION
	strncmp() compares only the first (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2.
	
	strncmp() returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:
	* 0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;

	* a negative value if s1 is less than s2;

	* a positive value if s1 is greater than s2;

RETURN VALUE
	strncmp() returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 (or 
	the first b bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or
	be greater than s2.
