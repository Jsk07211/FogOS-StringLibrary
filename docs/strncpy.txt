NAME
	strncpy - copy a string into a character sequence with trunctation and
	null termination

SYNOPSIS
	#include "user/string.h"

	char *strncpy(char *dst, const char *src, uint n);

DESCRIPTION
	strncpy() copies the string pointed to by src into a null-padded 
	character sequence at the fixed-width buffer pointed to by dst. If 
	the destination buffer, limited by its size, isn't large enough to 
	hold the copy, the resulting character sequence is truncated. 

RETURN VALUE
	strncpy()
		returns dst.
