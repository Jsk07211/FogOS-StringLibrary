NAME
	strsep - extract token from string

SYNOPSIS
	char *strsep(char **stringp, const char *delim);

DESCRIPTION
	If *stringp is NULL, the strsep() function returns NULL and does
	nothing else. Otherwise, this function behaves similarly to
	strtok() and finds the first token in the string *stringp that
	is delimited by one of the bytes in the string delim. This token
	is terminated by overwriting the delimiter with a null byte ('\0')
	and *stringp is updated to point past the token. In case no
	delimiter is found, the token is taken to be the entire string
	*stringp, and *stringp is made NULL.

RETURN VALUE
	Returns a pointer to the token.
