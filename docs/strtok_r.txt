NAME
	strtok - extract tokens from strings

SYNOPSIS
	char *strtok_r(char *restrict str, const char *restrict sep, char **restrict last);

DESCRIPTION
	strtok_r() is a reentrant version of strtok() that also breaks a
	string into a sequence of zero or more nonempty tokens. The last
	argument is a pointer to a variable of char * type and is used
	internally by strtok_r() to maintain context between successive
	calls that parse the same string.

	On the first call to strtok_r(), str should point to the string
	to be parsed, and the value of *last is ignored. In the next
	calls of the function, str should be NULL and last should remain
	unchanged since previous calls.

	Different strings may be parsed concurrently using sequences of
	calls to strtok_r() that specify different last arguments.

RETURN VALUE
	Returns a pointer to the next token, or NULL if there are no more
	tokens.
